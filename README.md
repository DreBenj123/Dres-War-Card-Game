# Dres-War-Card-Game

My project for my first big project in my software development bootcamp is going to be a version of the classic card game WAR!
I will be using the offical rules as stated by the Bicycle card company.
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.
If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.
The game ends when one player owns all the cards.
I plan to have a relatively simple design.
I want to have a green card table that sits in the middle of the users screen.
In the surrounding border around the card table I want to have the rules of the game
I want to include a scoreboard detailing wins, number of wars/won/lost
I want the player to be able to enter in their name
